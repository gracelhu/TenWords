- The purpose of the "back end small scale project" branch is to get the back-end team comfortable using Go and APIs (as most are beginners). 
- We decided to keep this seperated from the main branch because our team will eventually combine "front end small scale project" branch and "back end small scale project" branch when we're comfortable using the tools.
- The APIs we decide to use are unknown at this point in time but they will be updated as we make changes to this branch. 

Here's a link to the back-end team's design doc:

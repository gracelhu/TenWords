Project Name: TenWords

Project Description: TenWords is an interactive app designed to make learning a new language feel practical and fulfilling. Everyday, the user will be given ten words and their translations in their preferred language to practice. After they are done with the learning, they will be quizzed to enhance retention of the knowledge. This app is made using Angular and Typescript on the front-end and Golang on the back-end.

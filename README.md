- We are creating our own custom CRUD REST API that fetches 10 word packets from a wordlist txt file we created. Additionally, we will utilize existing API's to fetch the definition and foreign translation of words. 
- We decided to keep this seperated from the main branch because our team will eventually combine the front-end branch and back-end branch when we're comfortable using the tools.

Here's a link to the back-end team's design doc:

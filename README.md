Project Name: TenWords

Project Description:  TenWords is a language-learning web application that allows users to quickly learn a language with just 10 words a day. After creating an account, users will be able to select a language that would like to learn. Initially, our application will only allow users to learn Spanish. However, in the future, this will include other languages as well. Each day, users will receive an email notifying them that 10 words for the day have been posted. On our website, users will be able to learn the 10 words in the language through flashcards and quizzes. The flashcards will include text to speech options, so users can hear the pronunication of the words.
